# Traffic-Light-PIC
A traffic light simulation designed with PIC16F877A, programmed in MikroC, and simulated in Proteus. 
The system controls red, yellow, and green traffic lights, and uses 7-segment displays to show countdown timers.

An intelligent feature is added:
âœ… When the number of vehicles (read from RA0â€“RA5 inputs) exceeds 50, the green light duration increases from 20 to 25 seconds to reduce traffic congestion.
Otherwise, the green light stays at its normal 20 seconds.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used:
- PIC16F877A Microcontroller
- MikroC PRO for PIC
- Proteus 8
- 7-Segment Displays (dual-digit)
